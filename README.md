Autodesk® Fusion 360™ library for Python add-ins.

I add functions to the library as I need them, to create my add-ins. Every Python file has a short description at the top.

My Addins are free, but if you particually like them and wish to see more, consider [buying me a coffee (Ko-fi link)](ko-fi.com/zxynine)
